# Personal informations

I'm a Cyber Security Specialist in the Platform Evolution team at InfoCert.

I've experience in Java/JavaEE technologies and I've worked on designing and implementing software solutions in the fields of SQL Databases and E-Commerce SOA integrations ahead of my employment at InfoCert. I've also worked with the InfoCert "certified e-mail" team before joining the Product and Service Development team. I now hold a role that allows me to collaborate with the cybersecurity team while remaining in the application domain thus focusing on issues such as secure development and information security standards.

I've experienced remote (smart) working: improving my digital communication skills, managing my time effectively, using tools to securely remote access to corporate resources.

I hold a Master's degree in Software Engineering from the University of Padova, IT. My final year project was an essay on the process of creating an ICT Startup.

I enjoy photographing, reading, and traveling in my spare time. I've been a Chief Scout, I hold an autonomous diver certification and I'm into sports such as Road bicycle racing.

# Work experience

## InfoCert

**Contractual status:** Full-time open-ended contract, CCNL Industria with MBO.

| InfoCert | 04/2021 - Today |

**Team:** Platform Evolution

**Mission:** Oversees the evolution of development tools and core technologies for service delivery and oversees their knowledge transfer to teams.

**Competence Center:** Security Enhancements

**Mission:** To assure that products and services has been designed from the foundation to be secure, to ensure security and privacy of software systems.

**Involved technologies:** AWS Cloud, Kubernetes, SAST/SCA Tools (Veracode), Runtime Security Tools (Sysdig), QRadar SIEM, Kong API Gateway, Kong Mesh.

**Description:** I've designed the Application Security Policy that drives the management of the S-SDLC (Secure Software Development Life Cycle), or rather, the software development process that has incorporated specific security activities within its different stages.
These Policies define the activities that must therefore be carried out during the development stage in order to increase the overall security before it being released into production
This approach also guarantees savings on the overall fixing security process, compared to an undefined approach based only through testing activities carried out at the end of development.
I researched and analyzed possible tools that could be used in the enterprise to integrate the SSDLC and secure both the development chain and the operating environment; now these tools are in use in the company and I curate their evolution and their KPI.
I deepened the knowledge of security requirements for secure enterprise application development defined by OWASP and help DevOps teams in their understanding and application.
I've delved into application security issues in the cloud (AWS) and I'm CKAD certified (Kubernetes).
I specialized in API security because APIs are to date a major attack vector. API-driven cyber attacks lead to data breaches, customer data leaks, and lawsuits. I helped build a robust and reliable API infrastructure with the use of two key tools: API Gateway for north-south traffic, Service Mesh for east-west traffic. I led the team that deployed a "zero-trust" posture system by enforcing policies for transparent use of mTLS and microservices resilience and observability.

| Software Architect | Padova |
| --- | -----:|
| InfoCert | 02/2013 - 04/2021 |

**Goals:** Development and design of WEB Services for the SME market.

**Involved technologies:** Java 11, Oracle DB, RESTful WebServices, JBoss EAP 7, Infinispan, Quarkus, Prometheus.

**Description:** I specialized in designing and developing high reliability / availability web services with Java EE technology. I studied in deep the object oriented and functional programming with Java 8 and I studied the technologies of the JVM internals. I promote the application of design patterns and SOLID principles.

Each project involved distributed clustering for high reliability and I learned to tackle issues such as: replication, eventual consistency, asynchronous processing, fault tolerance and the circuit breaker.

I evaluated the adoption of cloud ready architectures such as microservices and related technologies (Docker, Kubernetes, Eclipse MicroProfile).

I have an in-depth knowledge of the main desktop operating systems among which I'm confrtable to work, I've also a good knowledge of linux server systems.

As databases, I can interface with relational and non-relational systems.

I contributed to the definition of company standards such as Continuous Integration, Development Environment, Code Review, Version Control, Static Code Analysis, JVM and Middleware technology updates, process documentation for ISO:9000, ISO:20000 and ISO:27001 Compliance.

I have specialized in the field of application security, contributing to the definition of company guidelines, I am also part of the team that guarantees security, identifies security faults, verifies the effectiveness of each security measure.

### Project: LegalCert REST

**Involved technologies:** Java 6, Java EE 5, Jboss EAP 5, PKI (PKCS#10, PKCS#7).

**Description:** Design and development of a frontend application to the registration and certification authority Infocert aimed at replacing old SOAP technologies with the most recent REST.

### Project: InfoCert Secure Access Controller

**Involved technologies:** Java 8, Java EE 7, LDAP, Infinispan, JBoss EAP 7, Prometheus, Grafana.

**Description:** Design and development of a custom identity provider which implement a self-taught protocol but also a standard one such as OpenID Connect 1.0 in accordance with ISO / IEC 29115. This led me to learn about technologies such as LDAP, distributed in-memory key/value data stores, JWT signature and encryption. Given the business critical task of this application it has been monitored for performance metrics with Prometheus (and Grafana for data visualization).

### Project: Sistema Pubblico di Identità Digitale (SPID - InfoCert ID)

**Involved technologies:** Java 8, Java EE 6, LDAP, Infinispan, JBoss EAP 6.

**Description:** Design and development of a custom identity provider which implement the AgID SPID SAML2 protocol. SPID is the (Italian) Public Digital Identity System that guarantees all citizens and businesses a single, secure and protected access to the digital services of the Public Administration. This application federates with _InfoCert Secure Access Controller_ allowing interoperability with InfoCert services.

## Personal projects

For the past few years I have maintained a personal server where I selfhost all the web applications I use (as an alternative to external services), in doing so I have been able to delve into all issues of web service operation and security in a vertical manner (deployment and update, managing disruptions and reachability from the internet with good quality of service). I delved into often underestimated network topic such as the DNS system by operating a local resolver on UDP and HTTPS protocol.
