# Personal informations

I'm a Lead Software Engineer in the Product and Service Development team at InfoCert.

I've experience in Java/JavaEE technologies and I've worked on designing and implementing software solutions in the fields of SQL Databases and E-Commerce SOA integrations ahead of my employment at InfoCert. I've also worked with the InfoCert "certified e-mail" team before joining the Product and Service Development team.

I've experienced remote (smart) working: improving my digital communication skills, managing my time effectively, using tools to securely remote access to corporate resources.

I hold a Master's degree in Software Engineering from the University of Padova, IT. My final year project was an essay on the process of creating an ICT Startup.

I enjoy photographing, reading, and traveling in my spare time. I've been a Chief Scout, I hold an autonomous diver certification and I'm into sports such as Road bicycle racing.

**Description:** I specialized in designing and developing high reliability / availability web services with Java EE technology. I studied in deep the object oriented and functional programming with Java 8 and I studied the technologies of the JVM internals. I promote the application of design patterns and SOLID principles.

Each project involved distributed clustering for high reliability and I learned to tackle issues such as: replication, eventual consistency, asynchronous processing, fault tolerance and the circuit breaker.

I evaluated the adoption of cloud ready architectures such as microservices and related technologies (Docker, Kubernetes, Eclipse MicroProfile).

I have an in-depth knowledge of the main desktop operating systems among which I'm confrtable to work, I've also a good knowledge of linux server systems.

As databases, I can interface with relational and non-relational systems.
