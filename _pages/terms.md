# Disclosure policy

I make money on this website through affiliate programs. If you click an affiliate link[^affiliate], you help support this website because I get a percentage of that sale.

# Privacy Policy

I do not track any individual people. As a visitor to this website:

- No personal information is collected
- No information such as cookies is stored in the browser
- No information is shared with, sent to or sold to third-parties
- No information is shared with advertising companies
- No information is mined and harvested for personal and behavioral trends
- No information is monetized (except where otherwise explicitly stated, see "Disclosure policy")

I run the Plausible Analytics script to collect some anonymous usage data for statistical purposes. The goal is to track overall trends in this website traffic, it is not to track individual visitors. All the data is in aggregate only. No personal data is collected.

Data collected includes referral sources, top pages, visit duration, information from the devices (device type, operating system, country and browser) used during the visit and more. You can see full details in [Plausible’s data policy](https://plausible.io/data-policy).

If you want to exclude yourself from analytics go to [this page](/plausible-exclude/).
