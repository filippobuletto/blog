# What is WildFly Swarm

WildFly Swarm offers an innovative approach to packaging and running _Java EE_ applications by packaging them with just enough of the server runtime to "java -jar" your application. It's _MicroProfile_ compatible, too.

WildFly Swarm is capable of producing so-called just enough app-server to support each component of your system.

# Packaging Types

## Uberjar

An _uberjar_ is a single Java `.jar` file that includes everything you need to execute your application, including: your compiled code + direct dependencies + app server.

The _uberjar_ is useful when a single executable binary artifact is produced and moved through the testing, validation, and production environments.

[Spring Boot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) popularized this packaging style, which lets you run the entire application only with a standard Java Runtime environment (plain ol' `java -jar uber.jar`).

Wildfly Swarm breaks the whole Wildfly Server into _fractions_ (some providing only a specific API, such as CDI or JAX-RS, other providing higher-level capabilities) and bundles in the _uberjar_ only those required by the code.

## Hollow JAR

A _hollow jar_ is similar to an _uberjar_, but includes only the runtime components, and does not include your application code.
So it encloses: direct dependencies + app server, without the compiled code. It's like a normal Java EE container server, but on a diet!

A hollow jar is suitable for deployment processes that involve Linux containers such as Docker. The application runtime and dependecies remain unchanged so the image layer containing it can be reused across code changes.

**This is the packaging we analyze in this article.**

## Skinny - Thin WAR

The skinny war contain nothing but the application code you compiled (basically _class_ files), this makes a lot of sense in the docker world of layered container images; the thin war is like a traditional web archive incorporating the code and the dependencies.

This is the standard _Java EE_ style, it is thin but requires an application container to run.

## Which one is better?

There is no general winner here, pros/cons of each one is trivial, it depends on your needs!

Good news everyone: [Wildfly Swarm supports all of them](http://docs.wildfly-swarm.io/2018.1.0/#packaging_types)!

# Code example

You can [grab the code](https://github.com/filippobuletto/skinny-on-fat-thin-hollow-and-uber) here:

```
 $ git clone https://github.com/filippobuletto/skinny-on-fat-thin-hollow-and-uber.git
```

Build the project with `mvn clean package`:

```
⇒ ll -Sh target
 69M 19 Gen 14:15 demo-hollow-swarm.jar
 22M 19 Gen 14:15 demo.war.original
6,2K 19 Gen 14:15 demo.war
```

There are three interesting artifacts:

 1. `demo-hollow-swarm.jar`: a _hollow jar_!
 2. `demo.war.original`: a _thin war_.
 3. `demo.war`: a _skinny war_.

During the Maven build there are three main plugin involved:

 * `maven-compiler-plugin`: builds application's class file (the content of the _skinny war_).
 * `maven-war-plugin`: builds the _thin war_.
 * `wildfly-swarm-plugin`: build the _uber/hollow jar_ and repackages the war artifact into a skinny one.

To start the application (which is in hollow packaging style) is as simple as:

```
⇒ java -jar target/demo-hollow-swarm.jar target/demo.war
```

The first lines of log display which part of the Wilfly Subsystem has been packaged in the hollow jar:

```
Installed fraction:                  Logging - STABLE
Installed fraction:         JAX-RS with JAXB - STABLE
Installed fraction:          Bean Validation - STABLE
Installed fraction:        CDI Configuration - STABLE
Installed fraction:       JAX-RS with JSON-P - STABLE
Installed fraction:                      CDI - STABLE
...
```

Theese are the _fractions_ (parts) of a Wildfly 11 needed by the demo application, resulting in less than half of a fully packed (and zipped) server.

```
WFLYSRV0010: Deployed "demo.war" (runtime-name : "demo.war")
WFSWARM99999: WildFly Swarm is Ready
```

Later in the log our _skinny war_ is deployed and ready to serve requests!

## Use the hollow jar like a slim app server

We have already seen how to package and use a Swarm application as a hollow jar + skinny war and this is all fun and games, but **every time we make a little change in the source code we have to stop and restart the entire service**, this is unacceptable!

With a full Wildfly and thin war (good ol' Java EE style) this is achieved with a componend named "deployment scanner" which allow the server to notice something in the archive has changed and go for a redeploy of the service.

But wait, Swarm can package all the standard Wildfly components, including the scanner fraction! Normally the swarm plugin includes all the fraction needed automatically using "fraction detection" but because this particular fraction isn't referenced in the application's code we have to request it explicitly:

```xml
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.wildfly.swarm</groupId>
    <artifactId>wildfly-swarm-plugin</artifactId>
    <configuration>
        <additionalFractions>scanner</additionalFractions>
        <!-- ... -->
    </configuration>
<!-- ... -->
```

Now we have to configure the fraction and tell it where and how often to search archives, this can be obtained with a portion of Wildfly's `standalone.xml` passed as a parameter of the _hollow jar_:

```xml
<subsystem xmlns="urn:jboss:domain:deployment-scanner:2.0">
    <deployment-scanner scan-enabled="true"
        scan-interval="10000" path="${swarm.deployment.path}"
        name="quote-service" auto-deploy-xml="false" />
</subsystem>
```

```
⇒ java -jar target/demo-hollow-swarm.jar -c target/standalone.xml
```

If you now move a newer version of your application to the path defined in the `${swarm.deployment.path}` variable you'll have hot deploy!

Now we can separate our application code from its runtime dependencies, and put them in separate Linux container image layers!

For example these can be:

 1. Base Java image;
 2. Layer with _hollow jar_;
 3. Layer with _skinny war_, this can evolve more rapidly than the _hollow jar_.

Consider this `Dockerfile`:

```
FROM java:openjdk-8-jdk

ADD target/demo-hollow-swarm.jar /opt/demo-hollow-swarm.jar
ADD target/demo.war /opt/deploy/demo.war
ADD target/standalone.xml /opt/standalone.xml

EXPOSE 8080
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "/opt/demo-hollow-swarm.jar", "-c", "/opt/standalone.xml"]
```

Will lead to:

```
⇒ docker build -t demo-wildfly .

Developers can be faster at edit/build/test their applications: build and start a _uberjar_ takes about 20 seconds, to do a hot deploy takes about 2 seconds! This will make your CI/CD pipelines faster as well.
