# Hello everyone!

I want to share with you my thoughts about an experiment upon myself. As you may have read from my <a href="/hello-world/">First Blog Post</a>:

> I also like to stay healthy with good eating habits, play sport (I'm a skilled road cyclist) and stay in contact with nature.

Untill now I was only focusing on my cycle training, that is indeed a very good cardio and endurance training, and I'm still enjoing it! But I wanted to focus more my body shape and muscle strength, because I was totally negletting my upper body parts.

I therefore decided to intersperse my cycle training with _cross training_ and _body building_ workouts.

# The Plan

As a good Software Engineer I start by enumerating the requirements:

## Goals

 1. improve body shape
 2. enhance muscle strength
 3. keep a low-budget
 4. use high-effective tools
 5. take advantage of _good enough_ semi-professional aids (in respect of 3.)
 6. must be household

## Tools

After some market research I ended up with these tools from Decathlon stores:

 * 500 Abs Bench (bought used, saving 25%)
 * 20 KG Dumbbells kit (bought used, saving 25%)
 * Pull up bar 500 (brand new, price very low)
 * Road byke + Home trainer (already owned)

Please note that they don't pay me, this list is for anyone who wants to know what kind of tools I'm using. :wink:

## Semi-professional (and free!) aids

How to start a job without expertise? Searching for a skilled aid may lead to betray goal 3... So I had to find some free (but proven working) tutorials about _cross training_ and _body building_ workouts.

My searching led to "<a href="http://videos.domyos.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Domyos E Coach</a>" :gb:, a free video coaching website by Decathlon, created to promote it's products. So I decided that it fits perfectly my needs and I'd give it a try.

## Plan description

I'm starting from scratch so I need to turn down the difficulty and split the excercises in groups marked with a letter and spreading them onto several days, in the first try I'll go for: **A-B-C-D-B-D-D**.

# Final thoughts

I want to track my progress (if any! :sweat_smile:) and fine tune this plan. What I hope to achieve is a good plan that can be carried on without too much effort (in terms of money but especially time) and hopefully be an inspiration to someone else!

May the <a href="/tags/#fitlife">#fitlife</a> be with me!
