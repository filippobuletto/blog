Lately I have found myself thinking that nowadays anyone who works in information technology finds themselves bombarded with new information all the time.

So it often happens that we forget many things to make room for the very latest information coming in.

Often the best thing to let the most useful or interesting things settle in is: slow down, take a few minutes to list and reflect on the most useful information.

That's it, that's the goal of this weekly column of mine that I thought of calling "Extrapolation": the format is similar to "today I learned," but without a specific theme so completely freewheeling.

You can find it on the menu above or via this link: [Extrapolation](/extrapolation/)
