## Something about me

Hello there! I am pleased that you’d like to know a little about me as you continue reading my self introduction hehe.. :smile:

My name is Filippo, I was born in 1987 in northeast Italy. I graduated high school to pursue my study in university. I took up a Master's degree in Computer Science Engineering.

Computer and internet are my time theft, I'm usually busy studying programming.. Yes, seriously, that’s true! I think I'll never stop doing that because software/programming world is constantly changing.

I also like to stay healthy with good eating habits, play sport (I'm a skilled road cyclist) and stay in contact with nature.

## What I Love To Share

Mainly programming, sometimes good habits advices. More often I'll refer my programming articles on <a href="https://notsojug.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Not So JUG</a>.

I'll also try to keep updated my <a href="/cv">CV page</a> as I improve my skills and I do more working experience.
